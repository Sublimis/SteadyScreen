### Improve screen readability of a handheld device while walking or traveling

Make reading on the go more enjoyable!


- This service allows compatible Android and Wear applications to easily counteract small device movements within their user interface.
- This improves screen readability of a handheld device while walking or traveling.


## How to make your application compatible

- Use the [SteadyScreenLib](https://github.com/Sublimis/SteadyScreenLib) library.


## What happens if the service is not installed

Absolutely nothing. Your Views and ViewGroups continue to function as if the SteadyScreen service never existed. They will never get a callback from the service, so nothing happens.

## History

The technology behind the SteadyScreen first appeared in our [Urban Biker](https://urban-bike-computer.com/) app in late 2022. It took us a while to
realize it was cool enough to release it as a separate semi-open source project.
