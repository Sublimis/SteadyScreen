# ‚õµ Stilly screen stabilizer service for Android and Wear üèùÔ∏è

### Make on-screen reading easier by softening small movements of mobile screens.


Ever been in a moving vehicle trying to read?


- This is a service that allows compatible Android and Wear apps to easily soften small device movements within their user interface.
- It can improve screen readability and possibly alleviate motion sickness while on the go, e.g. while reading in a moving vehicle or walking.


## How to make your application compatible

- The easiest way is to use the [SteadyViews](https://github.com/Sublimis/SteadyViews) library, which contains ready-to-use "Steady‚Ä¶" implementations of most common Android layouts (like e.g. LinearLayout or ConstraintLayout).
- Use the [SteadyView](https://github.com/Sublimis/SteadyView) library if you have a custom View or ViewGroup that you want to make compatible.


## About the service

[Stilly](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sublimis.steadyscreen) application uses the [AccessibilityService API](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/accessibilityservice/AccessibilityService) to retrieve interactive windows on the screen, in order to find compatible ones. The service then sends multiple "move window" accessibility actions to such windows, as needed, to perform the intended function. The data accessed during the process, using Android's AccessibilityService API, can be of personal and confidential nature (i.e. sensitive information). The application never collects, stores nor shares that data in any way.

‚ö° The service has been crafted very meticulously, in order to minimize resource usage and maximize performance. It uses only the accelerometer sensor to achieve the goal.
